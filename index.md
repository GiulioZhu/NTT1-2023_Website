# Abstract #
Field service engineers, particularly those at the junior level, often face challenges in diagnosing and troubleshooting router issues on the field. This can lead to prolonged downtime, customer dissatisfaction, and inefficient use of resources. There is a need for an intuitive and assistive tool that can help these engineers to accurately identify and resolve router problems on-site.

To address this challenge, we have developed an augmented reality (AR) mobile application for Android devices. This app uses technologies such as Google's MLKit for AR detection, Jitsi SDK for video conferencing, Firebase for database management, and the GPT-4 API for suggestive maintenance solutions. The app enables junior engineers to diagnose router issues. It provides real-time analysis and guidance. Additionally, the app facilitates remote collaboration by allowing junior engineers to initiate video conferences with senior engineers for assistance.

The AR-based router diagnostics app streamlines the troubleshooting process, reducing diagnostic time and training time. By assisting junior engineers with guidance and collaboration with senior engineers, the app allows for better field efficiency and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the integration of suggestive maintenance powered by GPT-4 ensures proactive problem-solving, reducing the overall maintenance costs. This solution will help junior engineers get a stable footing in the industry while ensuring a high quality of service provided for customers.
