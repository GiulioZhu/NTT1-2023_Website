### Week 19-20 (W/C Monday 12th February):

We continued working on the Jitsi SDK, found a few bugs with the app including the fact it doesnâ€™t work on android 14. We sent a Github issue and they responsed saying it will be updated in the next month, so we decided to stick to it.

We continued to work ont the Router recognition model, though it only had a 20% success rate due to the quality of the model and the way it integrates into android stuido. During this time period we were trying to fix the tensor flow lite model accuracy and started retraining the data.

We also implemented the barcode scanning feature.
