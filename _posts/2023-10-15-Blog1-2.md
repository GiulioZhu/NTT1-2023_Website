### (W/C Monday 15th October ): Receiving the Project Requirements and Constructing a set of questions ###
Our adventure commenced in the second week of October with the reception of our project requirements as well as our assigned group members.

Group Members:

Ayman Khan, Giulio Zhu, and Ahmed Ansari

1. **Augmented Reality (AR) Guidance**: To offer AR support to field engineers or customers for setting up or resetting hardware, with a focus on recognizing the device and its state to provide tailored field assistance.
2. **Automated Data Capture and Predictive Maintenance**: To develop a system for automated data recording of field assets and equipment, with integrated validations to enable predictive maintenance recommendations.

With this information, we created a WhatsApp group to ease communication and set up a meeting to discuss what to do next with our requirements. During the meeting, we created an email to send to our IXN mentor to set up a meeting with him to further break down our requirements. As our mentor was quite busy and out of the country at the time, the earliest we could set up a meeting with him was the 1st of November.

In preparation for our HCI presentation, we decided to start working on a skeleton of our PowerPoint, to include broad subjects such as what we thought the personas may look like based on the requirements listed above.

Here is an example persona we made during this time.

Furthermore, we started writing down potential questions to discuss with our IXN mentor in preparation for our meeting next week.

The breadth of the requirements led us to formulate several key questions to guide our project.
