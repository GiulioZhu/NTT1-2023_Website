### Week 3-4 (W/C Monday 23rd October): Skeleton for PowerPoint and Meeting with Industry Mentor ###

We continued to work on our PowerPoint and finalized the design of the skeleton and started working on possible scenarios that could be given to us by the clients.

On November 1st, we met with our IXN industry mentor, Tom Winstanley, as planned. This meeting was crucial in refining our focus and understanding of the project. We also established regular weekly mentorship sessions(as needed) with a representative from NTT Data, ensuring consistent guidance as we move forward.

The meeting notes are as follows:

The insights from this session were vital in shaping our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) presentation and the first draft of our prototype on Figma.
