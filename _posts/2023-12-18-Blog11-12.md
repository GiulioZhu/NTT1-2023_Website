### Week 11-12 (W/C Monday 18th December):

In these two weeks, after rigorous research and discussion with out IXN mentor, we opted to use MLKit due to the level of support available to it. However, due to the complexity of the task, it will take some time to learn it.

Furthermore, we opted to use the Jitsi SDK for our video conferencing solution.

We also completed an inital app frame and setup our development environments, ready to code.

Moreover, we decided to split up our work evenly so that we could start individually working on the project.
