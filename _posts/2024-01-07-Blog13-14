### Week 14 (W/C 7th January):

In the previous two weeks we started working on the report website, figuring out what to use to create our static site. 

We also had to make adjustments to our UI design based on the design features available on Android studio

Additionally, we started working on creating the viewfinder and experimenting with different APIs as initally we had created a bare viewfinder without MLKits integration to it.

We also setup the website with thinlinc and finished creating the elevator pitch 1.
