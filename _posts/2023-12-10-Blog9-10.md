### Week 10 (W/C 10th December) Finalizing requirements and Researching alternatives:

In these two week swe started to break the tasks further to be able to split the project evenly among us so that we could start to work in parallel. Furthermore, we completed an estimate on the amount of time that each task should approximately take, so that we can start to get a general idea of a timeline. 

We also had a meeting with Gadhu to discuss the use of Vuforia as after setting it up we found it to be quite outdated.

Thus we had to start researching alternatives.
