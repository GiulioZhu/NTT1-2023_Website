# Design Principles

- Simplicity: Prioritized a clean and straightforward UI by removing unnecessary elements and focusing on essential features like the AR viewfinder, video conferencing button, and diagnostic information.
- Consistency: Maintained a consistent look and feel throughout the app, including the use of colors and icons. We used a call icon, manual icon, and help icon all to indicate their use cases to enhance usability and familiarity.
- Visibility: Ensured that important elements like the AR viewfinder, video conferencing button, and diagnostic data were prominently visible and easily accessible within the UI.
- Feedback: Provide clear visual feedback to users during key interactions, such as when the AR viewfinder detects a routerâ€™s ports, and barcodes, or when a video conference is joined, when video conferencing is full, or when diagnostic information is updated on the GPT API.
- Tolerance: Designed the UI to be forgiving and accommodate common user errors or misunderstandings. For example, provided a clear error message when a no video conferencing meeting is available to join.
- Affordance: Used visual cues and design elements that suggest their intended use or functionality. For instance, made the video conferencing button look clickable or tappable, and used recognizable icons or labels for common actions such as calling senior engineers or logging in as senior or junior engineer.
- Flexibility: Designed a flexible UI that can adapt to different device sizes, orientations, and configurations, ensuring a consistent experience across various Android devices.
